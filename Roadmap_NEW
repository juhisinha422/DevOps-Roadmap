Planning to dive into DevOps in 2025? ðŸš€ Hereâ€™s your roadmap to success:

1. Learn GitHub Actions instead of Jenkins 
 Seamless integration with code repositories, security tooling, and higher industry adoption. 

2. Learn Terraform instead of cloud-specific IAC tools 
 Manage multi-cloud infrastructure with one powerful tool. 

3. Learn Loki + Grafana instead of Datadog 
 Cost-effective, open-source log aggregation and visualization. 

4. Choose Kubernetes over Docker Swarm 
 The industry standard for container orchestration. 

5. Prefer Prometheus over Nagios 
 Powerful query language and Kubernetes integration. 

6. Use Ansible over Puppet/Chef 
 Simple, agentless, and beginner-friendly configuration management. 

7. Opt for ELK stack over Splunk 
 Flexible, open-source log management solution. 

8. Focus on Python over Go 
 A versatile, widely-used language with extensive libraries and community support. 

9. Master ArgoCD for GitOps workflows 
 Declarative, Kubernetes-native continuous delivery with automated drift detection. 

10. Use Vault for secrets management 
 Centralized solution for securing, storing, and controlling access to tokens, passwords, and certificates. 

11. Implement Istio for service mesh 
 Connect, secure, control, and observe your microservices architecture. 

12. Learn Tekton Pipelines 
 Kubernetes-native CI/CD building blocks for creating containerized, composable, and reproducible workflows. 

13. Embrace GitOps methodology 
 Use Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. 

14. Study SRE principles 
 Incorporate reliability engineering practices to balance feature velocity with system stability. 

15. Practice Infrastructure as Code testing with tools like Terratest 
 Write automated tests for your infrastructure code. 

16. Set up Helm for package management 
 Streamline Kubernetes application deployment and management.
